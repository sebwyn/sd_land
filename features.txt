Editing:
**Movements
  - End of line
  - Beginning of line
  - column aware movements
    . changing lines shouldn't affect your column position

 **Selection
  - selection along any movement

  - selection mode -> cursor mode: good support
    . right arrow, will put the cursor at the end of selection
    . opposite for left arrow

  - double clicking selects words

**Copy and Paste

**Indention

**Parenthesis 

**Find
  - find in file
  - find in project

**Multicursor
  - select next
  - deselect last selection
  - insert cursor below and above

**Language support
  - show errors
  - autocomplete

**Autocomplete
  - snippets
  - langauge
  - text automcomplete

**Make it capable
    - better movements, suited to rust
    - Langauge support
    - really good support for running scripts on buffers

    - filtering buffers

    - everything is a buffer

    - pull in documentation from the web, with web scrapers
    - can I chat with chatGPT
    - ....
    - What does autoGPT visualization look like, can I view attention

**Make it pretty
    - background images
    - mutable rust variables, have a shader, wobbly affect?
    - animation, 100%, animated selection, animated cursor
    - make the ai dream on the text in the file, to create a background

    - what if each file has it's own personality, different theme, different background
    - what if thats imagery, and that whatever is dreampt by stable diffusion

**Other features/directions
    - Integrate message sequence diagram grapher, edit code directly from a MSD
    - hot reloading of code, this becomes the editor on top of the game?
    - hot reloading shaders
    - a really good api

    - an editor that lets you write code for it within it, think emacs?

Rendering other formats? Markdown?
 

**Optimization
  - Notes: starting performance: ~25% sd_land cpu usage, ~35% window server cpu
